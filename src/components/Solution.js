            <h3>Randomized Response Instruments</h3>
            <p>
              We randomly assign different effort levels to measure who's missing. 
              This reveals the hidden differences between responders and non-responders 
              that traditional weighting can't detect.

            <h3>Meet Polly: Your AI Survey Interviewer</h3>
            <p>
              Our custom-trained chatbot conducts natural conversations, probing deeply 
              into attitudes while maintaining engagement. No more fixed-format limitations.

            <h3>Meng Equation Implementation</h3>
            <p>
              We're the first to operationalize modern statistical theory that properly 
              accounts for data defect correlation in large populations. We measure exactly 
              how non-responders differ from responders.
